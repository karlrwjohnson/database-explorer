# Resource files that need to be linked from index.html
#
# Obviously, there are two kinds of resources, CSS stylesheets that are linked
# in the <head>, and Javascript scripts that are linked after the end of the
# <body>
#
# Paths are expressed as ANT-compatible globs relative to the source root
# in the order they need to be included. If a file satisfies more than one
# glob, it will not appear more than once.

stylesheets:
# External deps
- "static/bootstrap-3.3.6-dist/css/bootstrap.css"
- "static/bootstrap-3.3.6-dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css"

scripts:
# External deps
- "static/angular.js"
- "static/angular-*.js"
# Internal deps
- "static/app/app.js"
- "static/app/**/*.js"
